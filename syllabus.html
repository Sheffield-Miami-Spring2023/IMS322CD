  <div id="course-description">

    <h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 2.4rem;">Description</h3>
    <p>This course covers the basic coding patterns and practices present in all programming languages with an emphasis on those languages most common in web and mobile application platforms. It will take students through the fundamentals of algorithm design and then move on to expressing those designs in several popular languages. Because of the focus on web environments, this course will also explore the difference between presentation (such as with HTML) and interactivity (such as with JavaScript). The web and mobile focus will lead to rudimentary discussions on client/server architectures and what content delivery choices are available when a mobile device, such as a smartphone or a tablet, has such strong technical capabilities.</p>

    <h4>Required:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Laptop to bring to every class.</li>
      <li>Firefox AND one Chromium browser (e.g. Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Brave).</li>
      <li>A <a href="https://replit.com" target="_blank">Replit</a> account (this will be created for you on the first day of class using your miamioh.edu email address).</li>
      <li>An application for wireframing, e.g. Adobe Illustrator or XD, Inkscape, Pixelmator Pro, or <a href="https://www.canva.com" target="_blank">Canva</a>.</li>
      <li>No textbook is required - readings and other resources will be provided through Canvas.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Some media used in this class for pedagogical purposes (e.g. videos, song lyrics) may include coarse or objectionable language. You are responsible for notifying me via email within the first week of the semester if you would prefer censored content.</p>

<section id="course-policies">

  <h2 style="background: #C41230; color: #ffffff; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 1;">Course Policies</h2>

  <p style="font-style: italic;">This syllabus is intended to give students a general overview of the policies, procedures, and content for the semester. While it will be followed as closely as possible, the instructor reserves the right to modify or supplement it as needed. All changes will be posted to Canvas.</p>

  <div id="general">

    <h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 2.4rem;">General Information and Expectations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Being a full-time student is essentially a full-time job. I expect that you will commit an appropriate amount of time outside of class dedicated to readings and assignments. For a 3-credit course, this may be 6 or more hours per week.</li>
      <li>If you ever find content overwhelming or confusing, please convey these concerns to me in a timely manner and take advantage of <a href="https://calendar.app.google/J7pZwWrvF4vkoQ4w5" target="_blank">office hours appointments</a>. Good communication and consistent engagement are the most effective ways to succeed in any class.</li>
      <li>If you do not think that you can adhere to the policies and expectations of this course as outlined in the syllabus and on Canvas, I recommend withdrawing before <a href="https://miamioh.edu/academic-calendar/2022-2023/index.html" target="_blank">important deadlines</a> have passed. Likewise, I may "force drop" any student that has missed an inordinate amount of coursework. Advance notice will be provided via email in these situations.</li>
      <li>As an educator, my primary goal is to empower you by providing guidance and opportunities to develop new skills, think critically, solve problems independently, and exercise creativity. There may not be one "right" answer or solution to every problem, and in-class lectures and demonstrations may not address every variable or contingency. Be prepared to ask questions, search online, revisit material regularly, and try multiple approaches.</li>
      <li>I am always willing to listen, but some situations, academic or otherwise, may exceed the scope of my abilities or responsibilities. In these circumstances, I encourage you to seek assistance from campus resources (e.g. tutoring, counseling services, disability services, etc) - see relevant links at the end of this document.</li>
      <li>Depending on your specific circumstances, living independently may still be a new experience at this time in your life. You are the primary advocate for your physical and mental health. Eat well, stay hydrated, and get enough rest.</li>  
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div id="communication">
    <h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 2.4rem;">Communication</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You are expected to regularly check Canvas Announcements and your <a href="https://www.miamioh.edu/policy-library/students/undergraduate/academic-regulations/student-email-policy.html" target="_blank">Miami email</a> inbox.</li>
      <li>Use email for any correspondence that warrants documentation (e.g. requests for make-ups, grading errors or disputes, etc). Send all email messages from your miamioh.edu account. Include the course number and section in the subject line and provide sufficient information so that I can formulate a helpful response (e.g. things like dates and times, specific software applications, error messages, assignment titles, file formats, etc).</li>
      <li>I encourage you to use the <a href="https://discord.gg/PpjXBvwwXF" target="_blank">course Discord server</a> for informal chat, quick questions, and peer assistance.</li>
      <li>I will usually reply fairly quickly to emails during regular business hours (M-F 9:00am-5:00pm), but please allow up to 2 business days for a response.</li>
      <li>I am always happy to help, but before you email with a question, check to see if the answer is already on Canvas or in this syllabus. I also encourage you to just try a quick Google search. Sometimes, the information you need can be surprisingly easy to find, and solving small problems through self-directed research is an indispensable skill.</li>
      <li>The Assignment Comments system in Canvas is not designed for correspondence and should only be used for non-critical responses to feedback.</li>
      <li>My office hours are only by appointment via <a href="https://calendar.app.google/J7pZwWrvF4vkoQ4w5" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a>. This provides the greatest flexibility to meet everyone's scheduling needs. By default, all office hours meetings will occur online using the Google Meet link attached to the booking.</li>
    </ul>
    
  </div>

  <div id="technology">

    <h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 2.4rem;">Technology</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I encourage you to use laptops or mobile devices in a productive manner during class. If you are easily distracted by technology, please put away nonessential devices.</li>
      <li>I will assume that you have a working knowledge of any general technology required to complete and submit your coursework. This includes using Canvas, saving and/or renaming files, making backups, locating downloads, etc. I will provide demonstrations and support as needed for course-specific software and equipment.</li>
      <li>It is your responsibility to ensure that assignment or project file submissions are accurate, complete, and on time. Any late or missing submissions due to technical issues will still be subject to standard Late/Missing Work policies.</li>
      <li>Assignment or project file submissions will only be accepted through Canvas and Replit, not as email attachments.</li>
      <li>I am not tech support. There are on-campus and manufacturer resources available to help with personal software and hardware.</li>
      <li>I expect that you will keep crucial personal technology (i.e. laptops) in working order for the duration of the semester or make alternate arrangements if needed (e.g. <a href="https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/use/technology/tech-checkout/" target="_blank">checkout a loaner from King</a>).</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div id="attendance">
    <h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 2.4rem;">Attendance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This class will always be at its best when you are present, and you are much more likely to have a rewarding experience if you consistently participate. I expect you to regularly attend class; however, absences will not directly factor into your overall grade. I will regularly take attendance for general record keeping.</li>
      <li>Do not come to class sick. Stay home to rest and avoid sharing germs with your classmates and instructors (especially COVID-19). You do not need to notify me about routine sick days unless you will be missing a presentation or test.</li>
      <li>I am a strong believer in taking mental health days when done sensibly in balance with course responsibilities. They should not be used on days when critical activities are scheduled (e.g. presentations or tests).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="grading">

    <h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 2.4rem;">Grading</h3>

    </table>

    <ul>
      <li>Grades will be rounded to the nearest percentage point when determining overall grades e.g. 89.4% will round to a B+, while 89.5% will round to an A-.</li>
      <li>You should regularly check your grades and feedback comments in Canvas. Errors or disputes must be reported via email within a week once they are posted.</li>
      <li>Grade calculations are done automatically in the Canvas gradebook, and category weights can be found on the Assignments page. You can run hypothetical numbers for future coursework if you so desire. If your grade is lower than you would expect based upon your perceived effort, that would be best addressed by scheduling an <a href="https://calendar.app.google/J7pZwWrvF4vkoQ4w5" target="_blank">office hours appointment</a>.</li>
      <li>A student that has an overall grade below 40% at midterm (3/17) or at the final drop deadline (4/3) will automatically be dropped from the class.</li>
      <li>I am happy to provide detailed preliminary feedback on any coursework before the due date during an <a href="https://calendar.app.google/J7pZwWrvF4vkoQ4w5" target="_blank">office hours appointment</a>.</li>
      <li>Extra credit opportunities, if available, will only be offered to the entire class and announced on Canvas.</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div id="late-missing-work">
    <h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 2.4rem;">Late/Missing Work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sketches, Wireframes, and Quizzes will not be accepted late.</li>
      <li>Mini-Assignments, Assignments, and Projects are subject to a 5% reduction per day late all the way down to 0% (20 days). The submission date and time in Canvas/Replit will be used to automatically apply this penalty. If you are unable to finish an assignment on time, it is up to you to decide whether it is better to submit partially completed work or take a late penalty.</li>
      <li>I will often grant a set number of dropped grades for some assignment categories. Check the Assignments section in Canvas for the specific criteria. Click "Show By Type" to see the weights and rules applied to each category.</li>
