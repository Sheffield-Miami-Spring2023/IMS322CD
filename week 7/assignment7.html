<h2>Data Viz</h2>

<p>An analysis and visualization of some data points collected from the class.</p>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Navigate arrays.</li>
  <li>Work with data from arrays.</li>
  <li>Visualize data from JavaScript as HTML elements and CSS properties.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find the Week 7 assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit and click "Start project" to begin.</li>
  <li>You and your classmates were recently polled on the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>How far is your hometown from Miami University?</li>
    <li>How many pets are currently in your family?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Design visualizations for this data that do the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Show the average distance that your classmates collectively travel to go home (text).</li>
    <li>Show the total distance that your classmates collectively travel to go home (text).</li>
    <li>Show how many of each type of pet are in your classmates' families (graphic comparison).</li>
    <li>Show the total number of all pets in your classmates' families (text).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The data from the responses to these questions will be provided for you as arrays in the assignment template. Although this is a fairly small dataset that would be trivial to calculate by hand, you MUST do all data analysis using JavaScript i.e. all values should be collected and calculated using the array length properties and the values in the arrays.</li>
  <li>You will need to use the results that you calculate in JavaScript to directly change HTML attributes and/or CSS properties. None of these should be hard-coded into your HTML or CSS - they will be updated by the JavaScript after the page initi
    ally loads. Think about some of the ways you can approach this and the decisions you will need to make:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>How will you calculate averages and totals where needed?</li>
    <li>What kind of graph(ic) would be most appropriate for the pet type breakdown?</li>
    <li>How can you construct this graph(ic) using just HTML and CSS?</li>
    <li>How can you visualize proportions using CSS units e.g. px, %, flex units?</li>
    <li>What other attribute/properties might you need to change to show the output from your JavaScript analysis?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>The overall styling and presentation of this visualization should be fairly polished with consideration for color, fonts, layout, and placement on the page.</li>
  <li>Remember to click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh the browser preview update on the right side of the window.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Submission</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.</li>
  <li>Submit (copy-paste) the URL of your assignment's Repl (from the address bar) to this Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Grading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Grading comments will be added directly within Replit.</li>
  <li>One point will be deducted for each error, two points for a missing or non-functioning media query.</li>
</ul>
