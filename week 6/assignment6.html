<h2>Profile Questionnaire</h2>

<p>A simple form built using HTML, CSS, and JS to collect user profile information.</p>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Design an interface with select and entry controls.</li>
  <li>Attach event listeners to select and entry controls.</li>
  <li>Get user data from select and entry controls</li>
  <li>Create/modify functions used by event listeners.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find the Week 6 assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit and click "Start project" to begin.</li>
  <li>Imagine a fictional social site built for a community of like-minded individuals with a specific niche interest or hobby, e.g.:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Lizard terrarium owners</li>
    <li>Regional sandwich enthusiasts</li>
    <li>American hurling athletes</li>
    <li>Earthworm photographers</li>
    <li>Anything else you might think of!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Design a profile questionnaire form that suits the interests of this community. Your form should gather the following information:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>First and last name.</li>
    <li>Birthdate (or a different relevant date, like "lizard adoption day").</li>
    <li>At least 3 other pieces of personal information relavant to the community, gathered using at least 2 different types of controls suitable for the format of the information (e.g. radio buttons, checkboxes, text entry, etc.).
    <li>A color scheme that complements the community's interests.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Building your interface in a flexbox is recommended but not required. However, your form should be designed to work on both desktop and mobile displays by using a media query.</li>
  <li>Once the information has been gathered, it should be used to populate a profile bio section elsewhere on the page. This section should also include a default avatar image. Again, the color scheme and styling of this section should reflect the interest's of the community.</li>
  <li>Remember to click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh the browser preview update on the right side of the window.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Submission</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.</li>
  <li>Submit (copy-paste) the URL of your assignment's Repl (from the address bar) to this Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Grading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Grading comments will be added directly within Replit.</li>
  <li>One point will be deducted for each error, two points for a missing or non-functioning media query.</li>
</ul>
