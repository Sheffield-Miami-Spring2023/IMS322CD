<ol>
  <li>First, read the description for Week 6 Assignment: Profile Questionnaire.</li>
  <li>Decide on your community's theme and the questions that you'll be asking to gather user profile information. Then, think about what your profile quesionnaire and resulting bio might look like. What is the color scheme? Where will you put the avatar image? How will the select and entry controls be laid out?</li>
  <li>If you need references, take a look at how the bios on sites like Twitter, Instagram, Tinder, and other social websites are designed. What kind of information do they include? How is the different information presented?</li>
  <li>Create a wireframe sketch for your profile quesionnaire and bio. This can be handrawn and photographed or exported as an image file from Figma, Illustrator, or whatever drawing/sketching software you are most comfortable with.</li>
  <li>Your wireframe should include both desktop and mobile layouts for both the quesionnaire and bio portions.</li>
