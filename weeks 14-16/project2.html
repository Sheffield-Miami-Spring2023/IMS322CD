<h2>My Gallery</h2>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Description</h3>
<p>For this project, you will be creating a gallery of at least 3 of your assignments from throughout the semester. Eligible assignments are:
<ul>
  <li>Week 2: Responsive Photo Gallery</li>
  <li>Week 3: Distinguished Navbar</li>
  <li>Week 5: Music Player</li>
  <li>Week 6: Profile Questionnaire</li>
  <li>Week 7: Data Viz</li>
  <li>Week 9: DIY Carousel</li>
  <li>Project 1: P5 Poem</li>
</ul>
The assignments that you choose will need to be polished/refined and improved or modified in some way (see details below).
</p>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>3 or more assignments exhibited in a cohesive manner on a single page, either:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>presented separately (e.g. via show/hide or snap scrolling) or...</li>
      <li>with updated visual elements (e.g. color choices, fonts, etc) for a consistent look among all sections</li>
    </ul>
  <li>A means for navigation between sections - this could be accomplished through sidebar navigation, a sticky top navbar, showing/hiding containers, smooth scrolling links, tabbed interface, carousel-like component, etc.</li>
  <li>Your name should be visible at all times e.g. in a sidebar, sticky header or footer, etc.</li>
  <li>Any errors, inconsistencies, or layout issues from your original submission should be fixed as necessary. Additionally, each individual component must include the following improvements or modifications:</li>
  <ul>
    <strong>
      <li>Week 2: Responsive Photo Gallery</li>
    </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Title</li>
      <li>Consistent aspect ratios for all photos and/or image containers of the same orientation (portrait or landscape), avoiding unnecessary empty space and/or uneven rows</li>
      <li>Improved responsiveness of fluid photo sizes, ensuring that photos do not get too small or large (overflowing the body vertically on desktop or horizontally on either mobile or desktop)</li>
      <li>Improved responsiveness of the layout according to display/window size, accomplished by using at least 3 effective media queries (e.g. desktop, tablet, phone)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>
      <li>Week 3: Distinguished Navbar</li>
    </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Hover transitions must include a property other than just color/opacity and be improved to prevent layout "shuffling" e.g. an increase in size cannot push other elements around</li>
      <li>The image presented with the navbar must be responsive and adequately sized and centered</li>
      <li>Add a short text description describing how the visual elements of your navbar were inspired by the accompanying photo/product/brand</li>
      <li>The animation on the photo must be triggered when the section becomes visible</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Week 5: Music Player</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Add current time (min:sec) readout</li>
      <li>Remove skip forward/back buttons and replace with custom playback progress slider that can also be used to seek through the track</li>
      <li>Add volume slider and mute button</li>
      <li>If your original submission used the provided sample audio, it must be replaced with the song that matches your original design</li>
      <li>Buttons should be styled to look more interesting than the browser's default styling</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Week 6: Profile Questionnaire</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The question and bio section must either be visible at the same time (e.g. in left/right columns) OR the bio should replace the questionnaire upon submission</li>
      <li>Data collection and bio update should occur with a single "Submit" button (but NOT using the &lt;form&gt; element)</li>
      <li>Controls with default styling (e.g. checkboxes, sliders, radio buttons) should be customized to better suit the questionnaire layout and styling (e.g. change background color, size, etc)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Week 7: Data Viz</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace dataset with something else that includes at least 5 distinct choices/categories - this can either come from a survey that you conduct (e.g. using a Google Form) or data sourced from an online source (e.g. Cincinnati Open Data Portal or Miami University institutional data)</li>
      <li>Replace the original text output sections (average/total) with at least 1 relevant value derived from your new dataset (e.g. an overall total or the total of an interesting subset)</li>
      <li>If using chart.js, customize graph colors</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Week 9: DIY Carousel</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Carousel centered in body</li>
      <li>Consistent aspect ratios for all sections (e.g. no size/layout shifting when navigating to different sections)</li>
      <li>Improved responsiveness of carousel sections, ensuring that they do not get too small or large (overflowing the body vertically on desktop or horizontally on either mobile or desktop)</li>
      <li>FYI - carousels that used the W3 Schools slideshow/carousel example (using the plusSlides() function) are not eligible! (sorry)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Project 1: P5 Poem</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Canvas centered in body</li>
      <li>A responsive canvas size (at least width) - this will likely also require updating position parameters to use the width/height variables instead of fixed values</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

</ul>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Submission</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find the My Gallery assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit and click "Start project" to begin. Remember to click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh the browser preview update on the right side of the window.</li>
  <li>Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.</li>
  <li>Submit (copy-paste) the URL of your assignment's Repl (from the address bar) to this Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.</li>
  <strong>
    <li>These galleries will be shown publicly at the ETBD Student Expo on 11/30.</li>
  </strong>
