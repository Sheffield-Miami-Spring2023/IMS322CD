<ol>
  <li>Find the Week 9 assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit and click "Start project" to begin.</li>
  <li>A carousel is a container that can be used to display multiple related items in one space. Though not always the best solution, they can be very handy and effective when used in the right situations. Frequently, we see carousels as image slideshows, though they can also be used to display graphics and text:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> home page (at the top)</li>
    <li><a href="https://miamioh.edu/cca/academics/departments/etbd/index.html">ETBD home page</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/carousel/">Bootstrap</a> carousel example</li>
    <li>Many other examples can be found - e.g. the Netflix video gallery, sale banners at the top of many shopping sites, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>For this assignment, your job is to design and create a component with carousel-like behavior. It does NOT need to specifically look exactly like a typical slideshow - as long as it provides a way to show/hide multiple related content sections without requiring reloading or vertical scrolling, then it will meet our objectives.</li>
  <li>General requirements:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>3 content sections (slides)</li>
    <li>Carousel dimensions (width and height) should not change between sections</li>
    <li>A transition between active/inactive content sections (e.g. fade in/out, shrink/grow, translate on/offscreen, etc.)</li>
    <li>A way to navigate through the active/inactive sections (e.g. left and right buttons)</li>
    <li>A way to visually indicate the number of content sections in the series (e.g. indicators)</li>
    <li>A way to visually indicate which content section is active (e.g. hightlighted indicator)</li>
    <li>No use of external libraries - this carousel must be 100% vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
    <li>A media query is only required if it is necessary to make your carousel work in both desktop and mobile views</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Other general suggestions:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Using an active/inactive utility class is recommended (though not required)</li>
    <li>You can use utility classes in more intricate ways e.g. classes for offscreen-left and offscreen-right</li>
    <li>Previous assignments and examples have shown how to use arrays to navigate through a series of items - this could be a very effective technique for this assignment</li>
    <li>Transition times will likely be the best way to implement transitions - retriggering keyframe animations is difficult (though possible)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Remember to click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh the browser preview update on the right side of the window.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Submission</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.</li>
  <li>Submit (copy-paste) the URL of your assignment's Repl (from the address bar) to this Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Grading comments will be added directly within Replit.</li>
  <li>One point will be deducted for each error.</li>
