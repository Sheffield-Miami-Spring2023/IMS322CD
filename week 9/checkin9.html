  <li>Decide on your carousel layout. Will this look like a typcical left-to-right slideshow, or something different? How will users navigate the content sections and how will the controls be laid out? How will the carousel transision between different sections?</li>
  <li>Create a wireframe sketch for your DIY Carousel. This can be handrawn and photographed or exported as an image file from Figma, Illustrator, or whatever drawing/sketching software you are most comfortable with.</li>
  <li>Your wireframe should include the overall layout of the content and controls, control behaviors (e.g. hover, active indicator buttons, etc.), and content transition behaviors.</li>
  <li>OPTIONAL: You can optionlly choose a theme and design your carousel to suit the content theme (e.g. using highway exit arrows for buttons with a roadtrip theme). If you do, please indicate this in your wireframe. Otherwise, placeholder images and text is acceptable for your wireframe and final submission.</li>
