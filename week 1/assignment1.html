    <li>Dr. Sheffield can also manually add students using username or email address after your account has been created.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Go to the Teams section and find the "Week 1: Submit a Repl" assignment under the Assignments unit. Accept the assignment by clicking "Start project."</li>
  <li>Once the project (Repl) is open, put "Hello, world!" in &lt;p&gt; tags in the body of the HTML document. Click the green "Run" button to see the browser preview update on the right side of the window.</li>
  <li>Change at least one visible style property of the "Hello, world!" text by adding some styling to the style.css file. Don't forget to use an appropriate selector. Again, click the green "Run" button any time you want to update the preview.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Submission</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.</li>
  <li>Submit (copy-paste) the URL of your assignment's Repl (from the address bar) to this Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Grading comments will be added directly within Replit.</li>
