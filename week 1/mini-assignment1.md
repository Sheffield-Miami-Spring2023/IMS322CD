# Mini-Assignment 1: Introduce Yourself  

  ## Description
  A basic static website created using only HTML and CSS, this assignment will serve as review, an introduction to Replit, and a way to introduce yourself to your instructor and classmates.

  *Note: throughout the semester, all content in our Replit team is private and will only be visible by classmates and the instructor.*

  ## Procedure
  1. Add the following to your HTML inside the `<body>` tags:
      - Your first and last name in `<h1>` tags
      - A photo of yourself in `<image>` tags
      - A link to your personal website OR one of your favorite technology or media websites
      - Your hometown
      - Your major at Miami
      - An UNORDERED list 2-4 of your skills or hobbies
  2. Style with CSS as follows:
      - Change the background color of the document body
      - Change the background color of the element with your name (something that compliments the body background color)
      - Change the font family of the unordered list
      - Ensure that your photo retains its original aspect ratio and is sized appropriately

  ## Grading
  - This first mini-assignment is intended as review and to evaluate the class' collective prior experience - full credit will be awarded for submissions that attempt all steps.
