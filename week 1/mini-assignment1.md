# Mini-Assignment 1: Introduce Yourself  

  ## Description
  A basic static website created using only HTML and CSS, this assignment will serve as review, an introduction to Replit, and a way to introduce yourself to your instructor and classmates.

  *Note: throughout the semester, all content in our Replit team is private and will only be visible by classmates and the instructor.*

  ## Procedure
  *As you work on this and future assignments in Replit, click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh the browser preview.*
  1. Add the following to your HTML inside the `<body>` tags:
      - Your first and last name in `<h1>` tags
      - A photo of yourself in `<image>` tags
        - *This photo will first need to be uploaded to Replit using the 3-dot menu in the top-right of the "Files" section.*
      - An UNORDERED list with the following:
        - Your hometown
        - Your major at Miami
        - A link to your personal website OR one of your favorite technology or media websites
      - An ORDERED list with 2-4 of your skills or hobbies
  2. Style with CSS as follows:
      - Change the background color of the body
      - Ensure that your photo retains its original aspect ratio and is sized appropriately

  ## Submission
  - Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner of Replit when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.
  - Submit the URL from your Repl's Webview tab to the associated Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.

  ## Grading
  - This first mini-assignment is intended as review and to evaluate the class' collective prior experience - full credit will be awarded for submissions that attempt all steps.
  - Your submission will be viewed in-class at the next class meeting.
