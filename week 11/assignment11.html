<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find the Week 11 assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit and click "Start project" to begin.</li>
  <li>Create a p5 sketch that steps through different scenes displaying text from your chosen poem. The text should be divided into the sections that you intend to illustrate for your P5 Poem (e.g. one line at a time). Since this is just intended as an outline, all that is needed is solid text on a solid color background. For now, you can simply use the mousePressed() function to change from one scene to the next with each mouse click. Additional graphics or interactive elements are not required at this stage, though you are welcome to add them as time allows.</li>
  <li>Refer to the p5 "Managing Flow with If Statements" in <a href="https://ersheff.github.io/Miami-Fall-22/docs-week11.html" target="_blank">Week 11's class documentation</a> for an example of how to define and step through different scenes.</li>
  <li>Remember to click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh the browser preview update on the right side of the window.</li>
  <li>Also, remember that you can fork Repl templates for practice, though you will need to copy-paste to transfer code into an assignment.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Submission</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.</li>
  <li>Submit (copy-paste) the URL of your assignment's Repl (from the address bar) to this Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Grading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Grading comments will be added directly within Replit.</li>
  <li>One point will be deducted for each error.</li>
