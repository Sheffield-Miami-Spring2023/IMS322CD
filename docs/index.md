# Introduction
This site is intended to supplement other published readings with custom exercises and additional content relevant to the week's topic(s). CodePen examples can be edited and updated live directly from within the embedded editor.  

If you would like to save a copy of any embedded "pen", simply click the "Edit on CodePen" link - this will open it in a separate editor window. From there, as long as you are logged in to CodePen, you can click the "fork" button in the lower right corner to automatically duplicate the pen and save it to your own account.  

*Safari users: you will need to disable the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/prevent-cross-site-tracking-sfri40732/mac" target="_blank">"Prevent cross-site tracking"</a> option in preferences to enable live updates when editing embedded CodePen examples. You will also need to enable <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-the-developer-tools-in-the-develop-menu-sfri20948/mac" target="_blank">"Show develop menu in menu bar"</a> in order to have access to the developer tools.*

# Linked Content
Much of the weekly content on this site will include links to other sites throughout the page. There will also usually be directions guiding your reading for these links e.g. indicating which sections are important or noting when a link is provided as a large reference to be skimmed. Please make sure you are including these external resources in your weekly preparation.

# MDN Web Docs
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a> will be our primary reference for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documentation. If you are ever unsure about which HTML element or CSS property you need, search MDN.  

# Other References
- <a href="https://css-tricks.com" target="_blank">CSS Tricks</a>
- <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a>  

*These will be updated throughout the semester as needed.*
