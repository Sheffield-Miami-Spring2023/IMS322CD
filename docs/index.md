## Using an Online Code Editor (Replit)
This semester, we will be using an online code editor called [Replit](https://replit.com) for all coding coursework. Replit is where you will accept and submit all coding assignments and do in-class group exercises in a shared editor. This greatly simplifies several aspects of developing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including setup, previewing, troubleshooting, submitting, and collaborating. You will be sent an invite link to create your Replit account during the first day of class.
<br><br>
## Using The Embedded Examples
Another online code editor, [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), was used to develop the embedded examples throughout this documentation. You should be able to edit them directly within each page and see the live preview update as you change the code. You may want to expand some of the examples into their own window, especially those dealing with Responsive Web Design - to do so, simply click the "Edit on CodePen" link in the upper-right corner. You do not need a CodePen acount for this. If you would like to reuse any of the CodePen example code elsewhere, simply copy-paste the content into your own Repl. Anything in the CodePen HTML section should be put inside the `<body>` when used elsewhere.
