If you would like to save a copy of any examples, simply click the "Fork Repl" button - this will make a copy of the Repl in your Replit account.

# Using Replit
Assignments will be created for you and assigned in the Teams section on Replit. You can start, edit, and submit any of these by going to your Team.  

You can create new Repls in your Replit account any time by clicking "+ Create". We will use the HTML, CSS, JS template all semester. Be aware that these personal Repls are technically public. It is extremely unlikely that anyone outside of class will view these; however, it would be a good idea to avoid putting any personal or identifying information in them.

# MDN Web Docs
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a> will be our primary reference for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documentation. If you are ever unsure about which HTML element or CSS property you need, search MDN.
