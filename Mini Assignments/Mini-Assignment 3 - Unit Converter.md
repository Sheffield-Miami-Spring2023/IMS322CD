## Procedure
1. The script.js file is already set up to accept user input via a text prompt. Your job is to apply arithmetic operations using the provided variables to convert the input value to Celsius and Kelvin and display the results in the console.
	1. Celsius = Fahrenheit-32 * 5/9
	2. Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15
	3. PEMDAS rules apply in JavaScript! You may need this for one of the conversions...
2. Remember to click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh. For this assignment, you will not see anything in the browser preview panel, only in the console.

### Submission
1. Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner of Replit when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.
2. Submit the URL from your Repl's Webview tab to the associated Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.
