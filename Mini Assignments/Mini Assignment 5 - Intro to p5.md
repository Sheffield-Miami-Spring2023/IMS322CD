# Intro to p5  
<br><br>
## Procedure
1. The Mini Assignment 5 assignment on Replit has already been set up for you with the p5 library and a setup and draw function in the script.js file.
2. Draw at least one instance of all of the following shapes with different sizes, locations, and fill colors on the canvas:
	1. circle
	2. square
	3. rect (rectangle)
	4. line
	5. triangle
	6. ellipse
3. Animate one of your shapes by moving it across the canvas in either the x or y direction. Use an if statement to prevent it from drifting off the canvas (start it back at its original position when it reaches an edge).
4. EXTRA CREDIT: For 1 point extra credit, instead of starting the shape back at its original position, have it reverse direction so that it continuously bounces back and forth between 2 opposing edges of the canvas.

### Submission
1. Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner of Replit when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.
2. Submit the URL from your Repl's Webview tab to the associated Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.
