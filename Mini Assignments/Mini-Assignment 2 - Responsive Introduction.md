## Responsive Introduction  

### Description
Take your first Mini Assignment and convert it into a responsive flexbox with name and photo on the left, your lists on the right, and a media query that converts the entire layout to a column at smaller display sizes.

### Procedure
1. Copy-paste the content from your Mini-Assignment 1 `<body` into the `<main>` element of this new Repl.
2. Copy-paste the content from your CSS in Mini-Assignment 1 into this Repl as well. Adjust as follows:
	1. Style `<main>` as a flexbox.
	2. Adjust spacing, padding, etc as desired.
	3. Adjust the media query so that your entire layout converts to a single column at narrow window widths. Make sure that your content looks good at all display sizes.

### Submission
1. Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner of Replit when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.
2. Submit the URL from your Repl's Webview tab to the associated Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.
