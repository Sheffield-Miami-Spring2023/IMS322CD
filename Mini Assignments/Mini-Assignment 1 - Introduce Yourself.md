## Introduce Yourself  

### Description
A basic static website created using only HTML and CSS, this assignment will serve as review, an introduction to Replit, and a way to introduce yourself to your instructor and classmates.

*Note: throughout the semester, all content in our Replit team is private and will only be visible by classmates and the instructor.*

### Submission
1. Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner of Replit when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.
2. Submit the URL from your Repl's Webview tab to the associated Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.
