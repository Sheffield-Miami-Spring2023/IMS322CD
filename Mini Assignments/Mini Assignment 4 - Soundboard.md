# Soundboard  

## Description
Create a themed soundboard with at least 3 sounds. [Here](https://www.realmofdarkness.net/sb/arnold/) is a classic example of a soundboard that plays samples of speech from movie characters played by Arnold Schwarzenneger.

*This Mini-Assignment will be assigned to groups and completed during class on Monday 2/20. If you are not in class that day, you can either work on the assignment alone or arrange to work with another student that missed Monday's class. This Replit assignment will allow you to place yourself in a group if needed.*

## Procedure
1. Decide on your soundboard's theme. This may require some exploration to see what kinds of sounds are available i.e. your initial choice might not be feasible if you can't find appropriate audio files.
2. Some suggested themes:
	1. Simple drum machine
	2. Animal sounds
	3. Pots and pans and other kitchen clatter
	4. Car/engine sounds
3. Some suggested search locations:
	1. [freesound](https://freesound.org/) (requires free account)
	2. YouTube (using a YouTube to mp3 converter)
	3. [BBC Sound Effects](https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/)
4. Your sounds should be quite short (no more than a few seconds each) and ideally in the mp3 or aac format. You are welcome to record your own sounds and/or edit audio files to be shorter if you are familiar with audio editing software. There are also a few online tools that make it fairly easy to trim audio e.g. [Clideo Audio Cutter](https://clideo.com/cut-audio).
5. Upload your audio files to your Repl once they are ready to go.
6. Create as many audio elements and buttons in your HTML as needed. The buttons should be labeled to indicate which sound they will trigger.
7. In JavaScript, you will need:
	1. Variables that reference the buttons and audio elements
	2. Event handlers that trigger audio playback functions when buttons are clicked
	3. Functions that play the audio files
8. Basic functionality is the priorty - however, styling that fits your soundboard's theme should be applied as time allows.

### Submission
1. Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner of Replit when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.
2. Submit the URL from your Repl's Webview tab to the associated Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.
