<h2>Responsive Photo Gallery</h2>

<p>A 6 photo (with captions) responsive photo gallery built using flexbox.</p>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Apply Responsive Web Design techniques, like flexbox, media queries, and relative units (percentages)</li>
  <li>Practice embedded flexboxes for multi-dimension fluid grids (rows and columns)</li>
  <li>Incorporate high-quality images in arrangements that suit the original aspect ratios</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find the Week 2 assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit and click "Start project" to begin.</li>
  <li>Find 6 images on <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a> that all belong to the same theme e.g. dogs, bridges, musicians, etc. Download the medium quality version of the image files, and upload them to the images folder that was made for you in the assignment template.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>I HIGHLY recommend that you rename these files to something short yet descriptive. They will likely have very long names by default, which can be very cumbersome. You can do this either from your computer before uploading or by clicking the 3 dot button next to each image file from within Replit.</li>
    <li>Aspect ratio is very important! It is certainly possible to mix portrait (tall) and landscape (wide) orientations in your gallery with thoughtful styling. If you would prefer, you can either select photos that all have the same aspect ratio in the first place or crop them as needed before uploading to Replit. If you're feeling especially adventurous, you can rely on the "object-fit" property that was introduced in Week 2's reading to do the work for you.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A sample image inside of the appropriate containers has been created for you. Your job is to:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Replace the sample content with your own (captions can be pulled from the Unsplash entries or made up).</li>
    <li>Duplicate the sample content as needed to include all 6 of your photos.</li>
    <li>Use flexbox to pair captions with their photos in the desired location (based on your wireframe).</li>
    <li>Use flexbox to create rows of 2 or 3 photos that expand and contract with the window size.</li>
    <li>Create a media query that converts the entire layout to columns for narrow displays.</li>
    <li>Change background and/or text colors to match the theme/aesthetic of your images.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Other things to consider in your wireframing and implementation:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Will the captions be above, below, or to the side of their respective photos?</li>
    <li>Are all of my photos going to be the same size? Should I be using the flex property to make asymmetrical rows?</li>
    <li>How will I create consistent gaps and spacing between and around images?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Remember to click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh the browser preview update on the right side of the window.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Submission</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.</li>
  <li>Submit (copy-paste) the URL of your assignment's Repl (from the address bar) to this Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Grading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Grading comments will be added directly within Replit.</li>
  <li>One point will be deducted for each error, two points for a missing or non-functioning media query.</li>
</ul>
