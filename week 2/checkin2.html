<h2>Wireframe for the Responsive Photo Gallery</h2>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>First, read the description for Week 2 Assignment: Responsive Photo Gallery.</li>
  <li>Think about what your photo gallery might look like. Do you want perfectly symmetrical rows? Do you want to work primarily with tall (portrait) or wide (landscape) images? How much space do you want between and around the images and their captions?</li>
  <li>If you need a reference, take a look at how multi-image galleries on other sites are laid out and how they respond to window size changes.</li>
  <li>Examples:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></li>
    <li>Various Instagram profiles</li>
    <li><a href="https://500px.com/galleries" target="_blank">500px</a> galleries</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Create a wireframe sketch for your responsive photo gallery. This can be handrawn and photographed or exported as an image file from Figma, Illustrator, or whatever drawing/sketching software you are most comfortable with.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you're unfamiliar with the wireframing process, here are a few videos of varying lengths to help you get started:</li>
