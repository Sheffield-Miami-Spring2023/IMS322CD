## P5 Poem (flow)

*You will be working in the same Replit project for both the "flow" and "final" submissions of this project. The due date in Replit will be set to 4/16 for the flow version and then changed to 4/23 for the final version.*

### Description
A functional outline for your P5 Poem.
<br><br>
### Procedure
1. Read the Project 1 - P5 Poem description so that you are familiar with all of its requirements and guidelines.
2. Find Project 1 - P5 Poem in your Replit team and start the project. You will be working in this Replit project for both the "flow" and "final" submissions.
3. Create a p5 sketch that steps through the 3-5 different scenes of your poem with only the text displayed on the canvas. Since this is just intended as a functional outline, all that is required is solid text on a solid color background. For now, you can simply use the `mousePressed()` function to change from one scene to the next with each mouse click, but keep in mind that these interactions should be expanded in your final submission. Additional graphics or interactive elements are not required at this stage, though you are welcome to add them as time allows.

### Submission
1. Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner of Replit when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.
2. Submit the URL from your Repl's Webview tab to the associated Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.

### Grading
Full credit will be awarded as long as all poem text is visible and scene progression is working.
