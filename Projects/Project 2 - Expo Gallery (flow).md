## Expo Gallery (flow)

*You will be working in the same Replit project for both the "flow" and "final" submissions of this project. The due date in Replit will be set to 4/30 for the flow version, changed to 5/3 for the expo submission deadline, then finally changed to 5/10 for the final revision.*

### Description
A functional outline for your Expo Gallery.
<br><br>
### Procedure
1. Read the Project 2 - Expo Gallery description so that you are familiar with all of its requirements and guidelines.
2. Find Project 2 - Expo Gallery in your Replit team and start the project. You will be working in this Replit project for both the "flow" and "final" submissions.
3. Create three (or more) placeholder sections for your gallery selections. You do not need to move any content over from original assignments at this time - text placeholders will be fine.
4. Implement your intended gallery navigation. This should include any navigation links, buttons, anchors, sidebars, headers, and/or footers. Keep in mind that if you you may need to temporarily apply a fixed width or height to each section for now since they are nearly empty placeholders (e.g. if you intend to use smooth scrolling navigation, the individual sections will need to be tall enough to allow for scrolling).

### Submission
1. Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner of Replit when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.
2. Submit the URL from your Repl's Webview tab to the associated Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.

### Grading
Full credit will be awarded as long as all sections are visible and navigation is working.
