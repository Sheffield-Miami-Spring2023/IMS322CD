## P5 Poem (sketch)

1. First, read the description for Project 1 - P5 Poem.
2. Find a poem that you would like to use as the basis for your project. Remember, this can be a short poem, an excerpt from a longer poem, or your own original poetry (but NO song lyrics). If you're having trouble finding source text, here are a few searchable collections:
	1. [Poetry Foundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems)
	2. [Poets.org](https://poets.org/poems)
	3. [Poem Hunter](https://www.poemhunter.com/)
3. Your choice should take the objectives of the project into consideration - even at this early stage, think about how you might create visuals, sounds, and/or interactive components to accompany and enhance the text.
4. Create a basic pencil-and-paper (or tablet and stylus) sketch for the 3-5 different scenes of your poem. Your sketch should include some representation of the following elements:
	1. Overall layout of visual elements and controls.
	2. Additional details that describe the interactions and/or animations that will control or contribute to the progression of the different scenes. 
5.  Create an image file of your sketch. If done on pencil-and-paper, a well-lit and framed photo taken with your phone is sufficient. If done in a drawing application, please export as a common image file format first (e.g. jpeg, pdf, svg, png).
6.  Post a reply to this Canvas discussion with the following:
	1. The text of your selected poem or poem excerpt (post only the portion that you intend to use).
	2. The author of your selected poem or poem excerpt.
	3. The name of the collection in which your poem appears (if applicable).
	4. A link to an online source for your text (if available).
	5. Attach your sketch image using the "Images" button in the Canvas text editor.
