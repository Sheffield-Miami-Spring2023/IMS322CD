## Expo Gallery (sketch)

1. First, read the description for Project 2 - Expo Gallery.
2. Create a basic pencil-and-paper (or tablet and stylus) sketch for your gallery. Your sketch should include some representation of the following elements:
	1. Overall layout of the content and navigation behaviors.
	2. Indicate which previous assignments you intend to include in your gallery. 
3. Create an image file of your sketch. If done on pencil-and-paper, a well-lit and framed photo taken with your phone is sufficient. If done in a drawing application, please export as a common image file format first (e.g. jpeg, pdf, svg, png).
4. Post a reply to this Canvas discussion and attach your sketch image using the "Images" button in the Canvas text editor.
