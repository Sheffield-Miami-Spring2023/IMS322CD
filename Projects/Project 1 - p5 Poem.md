## P5 Poem

*You will be working in the same Replit project for both the "flow" and "final" submissions of this project. The due date in Replit will be set to 4/16 for the flow version and then changed to 4/23 for the final version.*

### Description
For this project, you will be creating an interactive poem using P5. The text for your project should be 3-5 lines, which can be a short poem (e.g. haiku), an excerpt from a longer poem, or an original poem (no song lyrics). Each line of the text will be accompanied by a visual setting/scene in P5. Progression from one line/scene to the next will be initiated by an action from the viewer. The individual settings/scenes can be abstract, metaphorical, or literal interpretations of the text.
<br><br>
### Requirements
- 3-5 lines of text, displayed one at a time, with a distinct setting/scene for each line.
- Each scene should feature an interaction related to the text that goes beyond a simple "click" control, for example:
	- Dragging a shape onto a specific target (e.g. a key to a lock, closing a door, etc.)
	- Clicking on the intended target triggers a short animation before transitioning to the next scene (e.g. a falling leaf, a ship sailing across the horizon, etc.)
	- Mouse movements or other user inputs (e.g. from the camera or microphone) control an animated element within the scene
- There are no specific requirements for the HTML or CSS in this project. You may optionally add HTML/CSS content to improve the overall presentation or add interactive elements outside of the canvas, so long as the other requirements listed above are prioritized.

### Submission
1. Work within the P5 Poem assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit.
2. Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner of Replit when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.
3. Submit the URL from your Repl's Webview tab to the associated Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.

- The source text does not meet any project guidelines, one or more scenes are missing
Interactive elements (10)
- The interactions in each scene are interesting and thoughtfully reflect the accompanying text
- The interactions in one or more scenes are one-dimensional (e.g. just a button) or not working as expected

Content and polish (10)
- All assets (e.g. images and sound) are high quality, color palette and other graphic content are thoughtfully designed and incorporated, scene content demonstrates consideration for the text
- Some assets are low quality, color palette and other graphic content is inconsistent, haphazard, or demonstrates little consideration for the text
