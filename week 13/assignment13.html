<h2>My Gallery Flow</h2>

<p>An outline for your Gallery Project.</p>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practicing navigation in a single-page site.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>NOTE - you WILL be putting this assignment directly into the Project 2 Repl, rather than a separate assignment. That way you don't have to worry about moving content over later.</li>
  <li>Find the Project 2: My Gallery assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit and click "Start project" to begin.</li>
  <li>Create three (or more) placeholder sections for your gallery selections. If time allows, you may want to move the current non-modified versions of the assignments that you intend to include in the gallery over to this new Repl. Otherwise, text placeholders will be fine.</li>
  <li>Implement your intended gallery navigation. This should include any navigation links, buttons, anchors, sidebars, headers, and/or footers. Keep in mind that, if you are using temporary placeholders, you may need to force the width or height of each section's content to take up much more space than necessary (e.g. if you intend to use smooth scrolling navigation, the individual sections will need to be tall enough to allow for scrolling).</li>
  <li>Remember to click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh the browser preview update on the right side of the window.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Submission</h3>
<ol>
  <li>NOTE - since you are putting this assignment in the Project 2 Repl, it will need to be submitted at least twice - once for the due date of this assignment (11/20), and once for the Project 2 due date (11/28).</li>
  <li>Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.</li>
  <li>Submit (copy-paste) the URL of your assignment's Repl (from the address bar) to this Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Grading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Grading comments will be added directly within Replit.</li>
  <li>One point will be deducted for each error.</li>
</ul>
