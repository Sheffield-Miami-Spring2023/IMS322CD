## Data Visualization

**This assignment does NOT have a separate CSS-only submission. Modification of the default HTML and CSS in the template is optional.**

### Description
A p5 visualization of a small collection of data points. 
<br><br>
### Procedure
1. Find a small collection of data that you would be interested in visualizing in p5. This dataset should include at least 4 unique data points that can be interpreted as visual elements. You will most likely find this data on a website, as a spreadsheet file, or some other kind of text document. Here are a couple of potential sources:
	1. [Miami University Institutional Data](https://www.miamioh.edu/oir/data/)
	2. [City of Cincinnati Open Data Portal](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/)
	3. You are welcome to design and distribute a survey (e.g. using Google Forms), as long as you collect at least 20 respones.
2. Transfer your data points into suitable variables that can be read through iteratively in p5 e.g. arrays or variables.
3. Design and draw a representation of this data in the p5 canvas that meets this criteria:
	1. Apply one or more characteristics to shapes or other graphical elements that show the relationship between your data points e.g. size, color, location, etc.
	2. Label X and Y axes (if applicable).
	3. Data values should all be referenced from the initial variable(s), **NOT** manually typed into the draw function.
	4. Provide one application of basic interactivity. The exact implementation will depend on the specific data you are working with. For example:
		1. Hovering over a shape reveals some text that provides background information about the data it represents.
		2. Allow users to click-and-drag the visualized data "objects" to better compare and contrast ther similarites and differences.
		3. Allow users to pick between 2 or more different ways ro represent the data e.g. data dealing with populations can be shown as percentages of a total or per capita.
4. Calculate one relevant general statistic from your dataset and display in the canvas or elsewhere on the page e.g. and average, total, etc. This statistic should be calculated when the code runs, NOT hard-coded in your JavaScript.

### Submission
1. Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner of Replit when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.
2. **Submit the source for your data** (e.g. a website URL, file, shared link to your Google Form spreadsheet results, etc) to the associated Canvas assignment. Faiure to do so will result in an automatic point reduction.
