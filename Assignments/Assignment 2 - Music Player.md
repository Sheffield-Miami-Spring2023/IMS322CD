## Music Player

**The full assignment description is provided below - however, you are only responsible for the HTML and CSS content for this submission.**

**For this final version of the assignment, all steps in the Procedure must be completed. You can copy-paste the `<body>` element's content and `style.css` file from your CSS Repl.**

### Description
A music player built using HTML, CSS, and JS that includes album art, controls, a time readout, and a media query to address both desktop and mobile views.

Examples:
- [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/)
- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)
- [Spotify's web player](https://open.spotify.com/)
<br><br>
### Procedure
1. Choose one song by a musical artist or group that you like. You will be designing this music player to suit the aesthetic presentation of this artist/group. This can be in response to logos, promotional photos, and/or specific album art.
2. Build out the structure of your HTML with the following:
	1. Button control for play/pause.
	2. Slider (input type "range") for seek and playback progress.
	4. Slider for volume control.
	5. Text area for current time readout.
	6. Image of album artwork or artist photo.
	7. Optional: You may want to create a `<main>` element as a child of the `<body>` that can be used as a flexbox to center/contain your music player interface elements.
3. Style your CSS accordingly:
	1. Design a layout for your controls and image. Using flexbox for some/all of your layout is recommended.
	2. Implement a color scheme that complements the artist/group and your chosen image.
	3. Use a media query to ensure your music player layout works well on both desktop and mobile displays. Don't forget to open your browser's Responsive Design Mode to test this!
4. Use JavaScript to implement the following behaviors:
	1. Audio playback using the associated play/pause button. This button should toggle between playing and pausing the audio track and change appearance to reflect the current state.
	2. Volume control for the associated slider. 
	3. Playback progress and seek behavior for the associated slider.
	4. Update the current time readout in the associated text element every second.
	5. FYI - A royalty free mp3 audio file has been provided for you in the assignment template. You may optionally replace this audio file with your chosen song. However, if you are not able to find a suitable audio file, your music player interface layout and style should still correspond to your chosen artist/group/song, even if you keep the placeholder audio.
5. After you have added JavaScript functionality, you should revisit your CSS and adjust as needed.
