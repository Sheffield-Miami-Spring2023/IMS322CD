<h2>Soundboard</h2>

<p>Hands-on in-class group activity.</p>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Description</h3>
<p>Your group's goal for today is to create a themed soundboard with at least 5 sounds. Here is a classic example of a soundboard that plays samples of speech from movie characters played by Arnold Schwarzenneger - <a href="https://www.realmofdarkness.net/sb/arnold/" target="_blank">https://www.realmofdarkness.net/sb/arnold/</a>. A group template Repl has been created for you in your class Team on Replit under Week 5.</p>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>First, collectively decide on your group's soundboard theme. This may require some discussion and exploration to see what kinds of sounds are available i.e. your initial choice might not be feasible if you can't find appropriate audio files.</li>
  <li>Some suggested themes:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Simple drum machine</li>
    <li>Animal sounds</li>
    <li>Pots and pans and other kitchen clatter</li>
    <li>Car/engine sounds</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Some suggested search locations:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://freesound.org" target="_blank">freesound</a> (requires free account)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> (using a <a href="https://en.onlymp3.to/32/">YouTube to mp3 converter)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk" target="_blank">BBC Sound Effects</a></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Your sounds should be quite short (no more than a few seconds each) and ideally in the mp3 or aac format. You are welcome to record your own sounds and/or edit audio files to be shorter if someone in your group is familiar with audio editing software. There are also a few online tools that make it fairly easy to trim audio e.g. <a href="https://clideo.com/cut-audio">Clideo Audio Cutter</a>. Upload your audio files to your group's Repl once they are ready to go.</li>
  <li>Create as many audio elements and buttons in your HTML as needed. The buttons should be labeled to indicate which sound they will trigger.</li>
  <li>In JavaScript, you will need:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Variables that reference the buttons and audio elements</li>
    <li>Functions that play the audio files</li>
    <li>Event handlers that trigger audio playback functions when buttons are clicked</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Basic functionality is the priorty - however, styling that fits your soundboard's theme should be applied as time allows.</li>
</ol>
