<p>A simple music player built using HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Design an interface with imperative controls (buttons).</li>
  <li>Attach event listeners to buttons.</li>
  <li>Create/modify functions used by event listeners.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find the Week 5 assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit and click "Start project" to begin.</li>
  <li>Choose a song by a musical artist or group that you like. Design a music player that suits the aesthetic presentation of this artist/group - this can be in relation to artist/group logos, promotional photos, and/or specific album art.</li>
  <li>Your music player should include the following elements:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Artist and song title information.</li>
    <li>Buttons (with hover transitions) to play, pause, skip ahead 5 seconds, and skip back 5 seconds.</li>
    <li>A thumbnail image of the artist or album art that fits within the player interface. This image should also act as a link to the artist/group's main website.</li>
    <li>A color scheme that complements the artist/group's aesthetic presentation.</li>
    <li>Building your interface in a flexbox is recommended but not required. However, your music player should be designed to work on both desktop and mobile displays by using a media query.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>FYI - A royalty free mp3 audio file has been provided for you in the assignment template. You may optionally replace this audio file with your chosen song. However, if you are not able to find a suitable audio file, your music player interface layout and style should still correspond to your chosen artist/group/song, even if you keep the sample audio.</li>
  <li>Remember to click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh the browser preview update on the right side of the window.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Submission</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.</li>
  <li>Submit (copy-paste) the URL of your assignment's Repl (from the address bar) to this Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Grading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Grading comments will be added directly within Replit.</li>
  <li>One point will be deducted for each error, two points for a missing or non-functioning media query.</li>
</ul>
