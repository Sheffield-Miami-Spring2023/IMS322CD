<h2>Wireframe for the Music Player</h2>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>First, read the description for Week 5 Assignment: Music Player.</li>
  <li>Decide on the song and artist/group that you would like to work with, then think about what your music player might look like. What is the color scheme? Where will you put the thumbnail image? How will the buttons be laid out?</li>
  <li>If you need references, take a look at how the music players on these sites are designed:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://soundcloud.com" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://music.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube Music</a></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Create a wireframe sketch for your music player. This can be handrawn and photographed or exported as an image file from Figma, Illustrator, or whatever drawing/sketching software you are most comfortable with.</li>
  <li>Your wireframe should include some depiction of the intended hover behavior (can be a separate drawing if desired).</li>
</ol>
