<h2>Wireframe for the Distinguished Navbar</h2>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>First, read the description for Week 3 Assignment: Distinguished Navbar.</li>
  <li>Decide on the product that you would like to work with, then think about what your navbar might look like. Will the links be left, center, or right justified? Where will you put the logo? What will the link hover behavior look like?</li>
  <li>If you need references, take a look at how the navbars on these sites reflect the product or brand through colors, fonts, and icons:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.wired.com" target="_blank">Wired</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theverge.com" target="_blank">The Verge</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://shop.panasonic.com/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/">Panasonic Lumix cameras</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com">Nintendo</a></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Create a wireframe sketch for your navbar. This can be handrawn and photographed or exported as an image file from Figma, Illustrator, or whatever drawing/sketching software you are most comfortable with.</li>
  <li>Your wireframe should include some depiction of the intended hover behavior (can be a separate drawing if desired).</li>
</ol>
