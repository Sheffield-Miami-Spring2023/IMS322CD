<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find the Week 3 assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit and click "Start project" to begin.</li>
  <li>Choose a physical commercial product that you find aesthetically and/or functionally interesting. This product (or the brand) can be current or retro and should have a fairly strong visual identity. Some examples to think about:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The original iPod</li>
    <li>Vintage cameras</li>
    <li>A retro video game console</li>
    <li>A piece of furntiture or home appliance</li>
    <li>A musical instrument</li>
    <li>A bike, car, or motorcyle</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Design a navbar that fits the aesthetic qualities of this product and/or brand with the following characteristics:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Construct the navbar as a flexbox</li>
    <li>Create 4 or more navbar links with approprate names (they do not all have to link to different sites)</li>
    <li>Put your links in an unordered list inside of the nav element</li>
    <li>Give your navbar links a visually distinct hover state with a transition time</li>
    <li>Add a logo in the navbar</li>
    <li>Include a photo of the product below your navbar that animates onto the page on load</li>
    <li>Create a media query that converts the entire layout to a column for narrow displays</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Remember to click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh the browser preview update on the right side of the window.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Submission</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.</li>
  <li>Submit (copy-paste) the URL of your assignment's Repl (from the address bar) to this Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Grading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Grading comments will be added directly within Replit.</li>
  <li>One point will be deducted for each error, two points for a missing or non-functioning media query.</li>
</ul>
