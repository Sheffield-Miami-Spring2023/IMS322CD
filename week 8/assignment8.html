<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find the Week 8 assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit and click "Start project" to begin.</li>
  <li>A generic profile search has been created for you with 12 pre-filled profiles. There are inputs for profile criteria fitlering at the top of the page. Your job is to:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Decide on a visual style to indicate valid vs. invalid results (e.g. profile card opacity, background color, display or hide, etc.).</li>
    <li>Add conditionals in JavaScript to apply the valid vs. invalid visual styling based on the provided age and music data-* attributes.</li>
    <li>Add a third data-* attribute of your choosing that can be evaluated to filter profile card results.<li>
    <li>Add an appropriate HTML input control and JavaScript conditionals to filter profile results based on this third data-* attribute.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>You do not need to change anything in the CSS and do not need to add anything to the HTML beyond your third data-* attribute. No media query is required for this assignment (the layout is already somewhat responsive).</li>
  <li>Remember to click the green "Run" button as needed to refresh the browser preview update on the right side of the window.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Submission</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click the "Submit" button in the upper-right corner when you are finished. This will notify the instructor of your submission time. You may click "Resubmit" as many times as you'd like to submit changes/updates - however, keep in mind that this will also change the timestamp on your submission.</li>
  <li>Submit (copy-paste) the URL of your assignment's Repl (from the address bar) to this Canvas assignment. This will ensure that it gets marked off of your Canvas to-do list.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Grading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Grading comments will be added directly within Replit.</li>
  <li>One point will be deducted for each error.</li>
