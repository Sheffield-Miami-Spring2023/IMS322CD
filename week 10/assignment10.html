<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find the Week 10 assignment in your Team (class section) on Replit and click "Start project" to begin.</li>
  <li>Draw a circle at the top of the p5 canvas (centered horizontally).</li>
  <li>Make the circle descend to the bottom of the canvas.</li>
  <li>When the circle reaches the bottom of the canvas, reverse direction so that it ascends to the top of the canvas.</li>
  <li>When the circle reaches the top of the canvas, reverse direction again so that it descends to the bottom. You should now have a p5 sketch with a "ball" that "bounces" continuously from the top to the bottom of the canvas.</li>
