<h2>Post Your Poem</h2>

<h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch;">Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>First, read the description for Project 1: P5 Poem.</li>
  <li>Find a poem that you would like to use as the basis for your project. Remember, this can be a short poem, an excerpt from a longer poem, or your own original poetry (but NO song lyrics). If you're having trouble finding source text, here are a few searchable collections:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems">Poetry Foundation</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://poets.org/poems">Poets.org</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.poemhunter.com/">Poem Hunter</a></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Your choice should consider the objectives of the project - think about how you might create visuals, sounds, and/or interactive components to accompany and enhance the text.</li>
</ol>
